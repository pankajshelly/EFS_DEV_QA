                    Monetary Contributions / Individual and Partnerships (Schedule A) is used to report all monetary contributions from individuals and partnerships. Funds received from candidate(s) and their spouses, as well as contributions from relatives of the candidate, are also reported on this schedule.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The date received, contributor code, check number (if method of payment is check) and amount must be included along with the name of the contributor to save the transaction. However if the address details are not provided, it might result in Deficiency letter.
                    Detailed records must be captured for contributions with contributor code as “Partnership, including LLPs” for amount over $2500. The partner name, amount attributed must be included to save the detailed transaction.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    At anytime the $99.00 threshold is exceeded from a particular contributor, from a single or aggregate contribution, during the applicable cycle (calendar year or election cycle, depending on the filer), then the contributions must be itemized.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    When a partnership's total aggregate contributions exceed $2,500 (calendar year for constituted/party committees/PACs; election cycle for candidates/candidate's committees) partnership details must also be reported.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Loans from candidates and/or their spouses should be reported on Loans Received (Schedule I).
                    Contributions from joint accounts are assumed given by the signatory (the person who signed the check). However, if the multiple owners of the account want credit for the contribution, all names and applicable split amounts need to be reported separately, using the same check number.
